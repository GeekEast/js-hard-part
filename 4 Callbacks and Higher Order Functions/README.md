### Ways of Learning IT
- Easy Learning: `Learn by listening`
  - Platform: Code Academy, Udemy
  - `Suitable for picking up basics soon`
  - Only make you a junior as final result
- Harder Learning: `Learn by suffering`
  - Platform: `Coursera`, `Edx`, `MIT` or even `CMU`
  - Try to build projects, solve `real-world` problems
  - Two sub approaches:
    - `Suffer by yourself`: google, stackover, github, paper 
    - **Suffer with others** Based on 1st approach but more **efficient** cause you `won't get into details too much` and let your partner wait for you.
  - Make you a Senior as final result

### Pair Programming
- One `talking in pseudo-code` while another `typing in vs-code`.
- One is called `driver` another is called `navigator`.
- `Alarm`: **This approach can be used during the Easy Learning Stage!**.

### Two things important in Coding World
- Solve real-world problem using code
- Communicate with others including coders.
