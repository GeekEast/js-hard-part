### Execution Context
- The concept of `execution` **context** is very important in Javascript
  - Gloabl Context
  - Local Context
### Default value in Javascript
- In Javascript, the values of all variables of `current context` are initialzied as `undefined`. Then after execution, these values will be `updated` or not.
- If one function returns `nothing`, it returns `undefined`.
### Call Stack
- Function call is in `Call Stack`
  - This is very important for `Recursion`
### Don't dive too much!
- `Code is practical rather than academic`
  - For example, people who developed `javascript` aimed to make `code`, `debug` much more possible and easier, rather than for any academic purpose.
